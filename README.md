# jfreechart-1.0.10-fastpatch

Patched version of jfreechart 1.0.10 to increase drawing speed in large-scale diagrams. See jfreechart user forums at http://www.jfree.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=18592

This is part of my masters thesis project, the topic was "modelling and evaluation of desynchronization strategies for controllable cooling devices".

Beware, this is from 2008 :)
